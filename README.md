# Speech-to-Gemini Code Generator

This Python script allows you to interactively convert spoken prompts into code snippets generated by Google's Gemini API. It uses Speech Recognition to capture spoken language and Gemini's generative model to provide corresponding code responses.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Capture audio from your microphone and convert it to text using Google's Speech Recognition service.
- **Gemini Integration**: Generate code snippets based on spoken prompts using Google's Gemini generative AI model.
- **Interactive Usage**: Continuously speak your prompts until you explicitly end the conversation.

## Requirements

### Python Libraries
- `speechrecognition`
- `google-generativeai`
- `PyAudio`

### API Keys
- A valid Google Gemini API Key ([Get API Key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-to-gemini.git
   cd speech-to-gemini
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install speechrecognition google-generativeai PyAudio
   ```

3. Set your Gemini API Key:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

   Alternatively, update the script directly:
   ```python
   GEN_API_KEY = os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY")
   ```

## Usage

Run the script from the terminal:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

Speak into your microphone clearly, and Gemini will generate code based on your spoken instructions. Say `stop` or `exit` to terminate the conversation.

## Example

```
Listening...
You said: create a Python function to add two numbers
Processing...
Gemini's response:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```
```
